Build steps:

1. Actually build the driver using Microsoft VC++ 2017.  You'll want both
   the x86 and x64 versions.

2. Sign it using the scripts in this directory.  Just run 'redo' from a WSL
   prompt.

3. Upload the resulting two *.signed.cab files to the Microsoft Partner
   Center, for Attestation Signing:

   (you'll need to log in as admin@tailscale.onmicrosoft.com, password
   is in keybase)
